Small dogs have unique care requirements that differ from their larger counterparts. Here are some essential tips to keep your small dog healthy and happy:

## Nutrition

Small dogs have faster metabolisms and need high-quality food specifically formulated for their size. They typically need to eat more frequently than larger dogs, usually 3-4 small meals per day.

## Exercise

Despite their size, small dogs still need regular exercise:
- 20-30 minutes of activity twice daily
- Indoor play sessions
- Short walks appropriate for their energy level

## Grooming

Regular grooming is essential:
- Brush teeth daily
- Weekly coat brushing
- Regular nail trimming
- Professional grooming as needed

## Health Considerations

Small dogs may be prone to certain health issues:
- Dental problems
- Knee issues
- Heart conditions
- Tracheal collapse

Regular vet check-ups are crucial for preventing and managing these conditions.
